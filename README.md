# Wildfire Prediction
Leveraging Deep Learning to Predict Wildfire

## Requirements

1. The project was implemented and tested in Python 3.7. The higher versions should work after minor modification.
2. Other common modules like numpy, pandas and seaborn for visualization.
3. Raw data were accessed through Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform with JavaScript.


## Implementation Details

### Data Preparation

The data can be accessed through [Google Cloud Computing Platform](https://code.earthengine.google.com/61be378aeafbe9bd100c547039938a94).Please see the code in: 1-extract-burned-area.js
