# ML-fire-prediction
An Empirical Machine Learning Method for Predicting Potential Fire Control Locations for Pre-Fire Planning and Operational Fire Management

## Requirements

1. The project was implemented and tested in Python 3.5. The higher versions should work after minor modification.
2. Other common modules like numpy, pandas and seaborn for visualization.
3. Raw data were accessed through Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform with JavaScript.
